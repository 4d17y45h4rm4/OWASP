## Summary

Credentials are the most widely used authentication technology. Due to such a wide usage of username-password pairs, users are no longer able to properly handle their credentials across the multitude of used applications.

In order to assist users with their credentials, multiple technologies surfaced:

- Applications provide a *remember me* functionality that allows the user to stay authenticated for long periods of time, without asking the user again for their credentials.
- Password Managers' - including browser password managers - that allow the user to store their credentials in a secure manner and later on inject them in user-forms without any user intervention.

## How to Test

- Look for passwords being stored in a cookie. Examine the cookies stored by the application. Verify that the credentials are not stored in clear text, but are hashed.
- Examine the hashing mechanism: if it is a common, well-known algorithm, check for its strength; in homegrown hash functions, attempt several usernames to check whether the hash function is easily guessable.
- Verify that the credentials are only sent during the log in phase, and not sent together with every request to the application.
- Consider other sensitive form fields (e.g. an answer to a secret question that must be entered in a password recovery or account unlock form).

## Remediation

Ensure that no credentials are stored in clear text or are easily retrievable in encoded or encrypted forms in cookies.
