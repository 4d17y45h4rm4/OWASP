# Testing for Client Side SQL Injection

<!-- The SQLi tests require a Title update to be uniform-->

## Summary

Client-side SQL injection occurs when an application implements the [Web SQL Database](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) technology and doesn't properly validate the input nor parametrize its query variables. This DataBase (DB) is manipulated by using JavaScript (JS) API calls, such as `openDatabase()`, which creates or opens an existing database.

## Test Objectives

The following test scenario will validate that proper input validation is conducted. If the implementation is vulnerable, the attacker is able to extract the database information, manipulate it, or delete it.
