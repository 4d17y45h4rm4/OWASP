# Testing for Format String

## Summary

A format string is a null-terminated character sequence that also contains conversion specifiers interpreted or converted at runtime. If server-side code [concatenates a user's input with a format string](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/string-concatenation-format-string-vulnerabilities/), an attacker can append additional conversion specifications to cause a runtime error, information disclosure, or buffer overflow.

The worst case for format strings vulnerabilities occur in languages that don't check arguments and also include a `%n` specifier that writes to memory. These functions, if exploited by an attacker modifying a format string, could cause [information disclosure and code execution](https://www.veracode.com/security/format-string):

* C and C++ [printf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf) and similar methods fprintf, sprintf, snprintf
* Perl [printf](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/printf.html) and sprintf

These format string functions can't write to memory, but attackers can still cause information disclosure by changing format strings to output values the developers did not intend to send:

* Python 2.6 and 2.7 [str.format](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html) and Python 3 unicode [str.format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) can be modified by injecting strings that can point to [other variables](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format/) in memory

The following format strings if modified can cause runtime errors if the attacker adds conversion specifier:

* Java [String.format](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#format(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...)) and [PrintStream.format](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintStream.html#format(java.util.Locale,java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...))
* PHP [printf](https://www.php.net/manual/es/function.printf.php)

The code pattern that causes a format string vulnerability is usually an append or concatenate to the format string argument of a _printf_ or _format_ function. The following example shows how a debug printf could cause the issue:

The example in C:

```c
#define BUFFER_SIZE 200
// ...
char *userName = /* input from user controlled field */;

char outputGreeting[BUFFER_SIZE];
printf("DEBUG Current user: ");
// Vulnerable debugging code
printf(userName);
```

The example in Java:

```java
final String userName = /* input from user controlled field */;

System.out.printf("DEBUG Current user:");
// Vulnerable code:
System.out.printf(userName);
```

In this particular example, if the attacker set their `userName` to have one or more conversion specifiers, there would be unwanted behaviour. The C example would [print out memory contents](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-18/dc-18-presentations/Haas/DEFCON-18-Haas-Adv-Format-String-Attacks.pdf) if `userName` contained `%p%p%p%p%p`, and it can corrupt memory contents if there is a `%n` in the string. In Java example, a `username` containing any specifier that needs an input including `%x` or `%s` would cause the program to crash with `IllegalArgumentException`. Although the examples are still subject to other problems, the vulnerability can be fixed by printf arguments of `printf("DEBUG Current user: %s", userName)`.


## Test Objectives

Assess whether injecting format string conversion specifiers into user-controlled fields causes undesired behaviour from the application.

## How to Test

### Static Analysis

Static analysis tools can find format string vulnerabilities in either the code or in binaries. Examples of tools include:

* C and C++: [Flawfinder](https://dwheeler.com/flawfinder/)  
* Java: FindSecurityBugs rule [FORMAT_STRING_MANIPULATION](https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/bugs.htm#FORMAT_STRING_MANIPULATION)
* PHP: String formatter Analyzer in [phpsa](https://github.com/ovr/phpsa/blob/master/docs/05_Analyzers.md#function_string_formater)

### Manual Code Inspection

Static analysis may miss more subtle cases including format strings generated by complex code. To look for vulnerabilities manually in a codebase, a tester can look for all calls in the codebase that accept a format string and trace back to make sure untrusted input cannot change the format string.

### Conversion Specifier Injection

Testers can check at the unit test or full system test level by sending conversion specifiers in any string input. [Fuzz](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing) the program using all of the conversion specifiers for all languages the system under test uses. See the [OWASP Format string attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack) page for possible inputs to use. If the test fails, the program will crash or display an unexpected output. If the test passes, the attempt to send a conversion specifier should be blocked, or the string should go through the system with no issues as with any other valid input.
