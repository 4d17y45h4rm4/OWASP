# OWASP-Testing-Guide-v5

Welcome to the OWASP Testing Guide (OTG) v5 repository!<br>

## Discussion/Support

Join the Testing Guide Google Group if there are things you want to discuss https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/testing-guide-project

## We Need You!
* Checkout the issue tracker, tackle creating some new content.
* Read through some content and provide feedback (new issues with specific quotes/issues and potential solutions).
* Clean-up existing v4 content (the migration from the OWASP Media wiki to Github markup wasn't seamless, there is lots of stuff that can be tackled). (Ex: [Existing Clean-up PRs](https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-Testing-Guide-v5/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+v5%2310))

## Style/Contribution Guidelines

* Please don't write in the first person (Ex: no "I" or "Me" statements).
* Please do use Title Caps for headings, using Title Capitalization as defined by the 'Chicago Manual of Style'. For quick reference you can use this online tool: [https://capitalizemytitle.com/#Chicago](https://capitalizemytitle.com/#Chicago) (make sure you select the "Chicago" tab).
* Please do use serial or Oxford commas (https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/).
* Don't use `and/or`, chances are you can simply write `or`. (Note: The OR allows for the same True result as an AND, while also allowing for other combinations producing True results.) Unless, you actually mean something like "A and/exclusive or B" in which case read the sentence to yourself with those words and then figure out a different way to write it &#9786;
