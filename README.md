## Contributions, Feature Requests, and Feedback

**Everyone can contribute!** By simply reading the document (which you certainly should do), grammar mistakes, new ideas, or paragraph restructuring thoughts will show themselves! Just try it out, you'll see :smile:

Whenever you identify a contribution possibility, open up an [issue](https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-Testing-Guide-v5/issues) with it in order for us to keep track and assign project milestones.

Despite us being technical, we love having technical and casual chats with others. Join us by following the below steps:

- Join this project's [channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T04T40NHX/CJ2QDHLRJ) (yes, you can join other channels, we won't stop you!).

Before you start contributing, please check our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) which should help you get started and follow our best practices.

## Style Guidelines

* Please don't write in the first person (Ex: no "I" or "Me" statements).
* Please do use Title Caps for headings, using Title Capitalization as defined by the 'Chicago Manual of Style'. For quick reference you can use this online tool: [https://capitalizemytitle.com/#Chicago](https://capitalizemytitle.com/#Chicago) (make sure you select the "Chicago" tab).
* Please do use serial or Oxford commas (https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/).
* Don't use `and/or`, chances are you can simply write `or`. (Note: The OR allows for the same True result as an AND, while also allowing for other combinations producing True results.) Unless, you actually mean something like "A and/exclusive or B" in which case read the sentence to yourself with those words and then figure out a different way to write it &#9786;
