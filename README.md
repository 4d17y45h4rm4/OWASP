Welcome to the official repository for the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG). The WSTG is a comprehensive guide to testing the security of web applications and web services. Created by the collaborative efforts of security professionals and dedicated volunteers, the WSTG provides a framework of best practices used by penetration testers and organizations all over the world.

We are currently working on release version 5.0. You can [read the current document here on GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg/tree/master/document).
